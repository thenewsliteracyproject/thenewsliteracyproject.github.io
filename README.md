# thenewsliteracyproject.github.io

This is a placeholder website for the News Literacy Project while a [new version](https://github.com/thenewsliteracyproject/thenewsliteracyproject-website) is developed. An older version, built on Drupal, was copied down using wget's mirror functionality, using the command:

    $ wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/

After the site was mirrored, we created a new GitHub repository called [thenewsliteracyproject.github.io](https://github.com/thenewsliteracyproject/thenewsliteracyproject.github.io). Choosing this name for the respository signifies that it should be served to the public using GitHub Pages at the URL https://thenewsliteracyproject.github.io/.
